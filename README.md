**Author**: Jacob H. /  Brittany H. / Ben B.
**Version**: 3.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

This is a Back-end server for City Explorer to convert the location of a user input to Latitude/Longitude of a user-input location. This will place a request to the back-end server to display current weather information based on the user's location. If the user has submitted erroneous location data, an Error will display to inform the user of this mistake. 

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a developer user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Install Node, Express, Dotenv, and CORS. Run NPM Start with package-lock.json.

## Architecture
<!-- To the best of your ability, provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. The audience would be a new developer user to the project -->

We will be building this back-end using Node.js, Express, Dotenv, and CORS.
